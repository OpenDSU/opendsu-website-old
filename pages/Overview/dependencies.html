<psk-page title="PrivateSky Dependencies">
    <psk-description>
        Due to security and confidentiality requirements of the PrivateSky  platform we decided to avoid using external NPM packages.
        One of the main strong points of PrivateSky is the capacity to build a new type of Digital Wallets capable to embed Self Sovereign Application or blockchain based backends.
        The security and privacy levels on such systems should be very high and having hundreds or thousands dependencies does not help.
        For the UI we have created a small MVC framework called Cardinal.
        We also have build our simple installation system called Octopus and a testing framework called double-check. Just check package.json in the PrivateSky project.
        The only external dependency that remained  is Browserify.
        While this could look like a case of "not invented here syndrome" this approach seems to work fine as all tools are perfectly customised for the PrivateSky ecosystem.

    <psk-chapter title="Dependencies Management">
        <b>This part is obsolete, will be replaced by the Octopus documentation! </b>

        PrivateSky project has a dedicated script that handles dependencies management (install, update etc.)<br>
        The script that handles PrivateSky deps can be found in <b>"bin/scripts/build-devel.js"</b>.
        <psk-code language="bash">
            cd privatesky/bin/scripts
            cat build-devel.js
        </psk-code>
        The role of <b>build-devel.js</b> file is to run a specific configuration when somebody needs to install or update a PrivateSky installation dependencies.
        <psk-chapter title="Adding a dep">
            To add a new dependency in a PrivateSky installation just modify the config JSON object present in <b>build-devel.js</b> accordingly.
            If you need to add a <b>dependency from npm</b> just add something like this in the JSON:
            <psk-code language="json">
                {
                "name": "name_of_npm_dependency",
                "src": "npm",
                "actions": ["install"]
                }
            </psk-code>
            If you need to add a <b>dependency from Github</b>, just add something like this in the JSON:
            <psk-code language="json">
                {
                "name": "name_of_target_folder_dependency",
                "src": "https://github.com/name_of_organization_or_github_user/name_of_github_dependecy.git"
                }
            </psk-code>
        </psk-chapter>
        <psk-chapter title="Removing a dep">
            If you need to remove a dependency first ensure that there is no usage into the project and only then remove the dep object from JSON config found in <b>build-devel.js</b>.
        </psk-chapter>
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="Install dependencies">
        Once a dependency is added, run <b>npm install</b> or <b>npm run update</b> command according to the project's status.
