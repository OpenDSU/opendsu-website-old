        <psk-chapter title="Clone ssapp-demo-workspace">
            First of all, create a local clone of the ssapp-demo-workspace Github project:
            <psk-code language="bash">
                git clone https://github.com/PrivateSky/ssapp-demo-workspace.git
            </psk-code>
            Enter into checkout folder and run the following command:
            <psk-code language="bash">
                npm install
            </psk-code>

            Optionally (if something crashed or you add changes) do a privatesky build
            <psk-code language="bash">
                cd privatesky
                npm install
                #if you want to run the tests, have to install zeromq manually
                #npm install zeromq@4.6.0
                npm run build
                cd ..

            </psk-code>

            Wait for a message like "Domain boot successfully" and then open a new terminal and build all the ssapps, wallets, etc in the current project
            <psk-code language="bash">
                npm run build-all
            </psk-code>

  <psk-chapter title="Setup PrivateSky">
    <psk-description>
      The setup process of PrivateSky <b>(contributors project version)</b> can be reduced to git clone the project and run npm install process. (steps bellow)
    </psk-description>
    <psk-chapter title="Install a PSK Node (contributors project version)">
      First of all, create a local clone of the PrivateSky Github project:
          <psk-code language="bash">
            git clone https://github.com/PrivateSky/privatesky.git
          </psk-code>
      Enter into checkout folder and run the following command:
          <psk-code language="bash">
            cd privatesky
            npm install
          </psk-code>
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="Install a PSK Node (release version)">
      First of all, create a local clone of the PrivateSky Github project:
      <psk-code language="bash">
        git clone https://github.com/PrivateSky/psk-release.git
      </psk-code>
      Enter into checkout folder and run the following command:
      <psk-code language="bash">
        cd privatesky
        npm install
      </psk-code>
    </psk-chapter>
  </psk-chapter>



    <psk-chapter title="Run PSK Node">
    The Node version is checked and if is all good the installation process begins by downloading the required dependencies. Once the installation process has finished successfully, the following command needs to be run:
        <psk-code language="bash">
          npm run start
        </psk-code>
    At this point, the PrivateSky installation is <b>done</b> and the PrivateSky Node is up and <b>ready to go!</b>
  </psk-chapter>
  <psk-chapter title="Run PSK Node during development">
    <psk-description>
      The difference is that during development PSK Node code is necessary to be rebuilt every time that source code and folders are modified according to the project's needs.
    </psk-description>
    During development, instead of the <b>npm run start</b> command run
    <psk-code language="bash">
      npm run watch
    </psk-code>
  </psk-chapter>
  <psk-chapter title="Update">
    To update an existing PrivateSky installation run command:
    <psk-code language="bash">
