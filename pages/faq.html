    <psk-chapter title="How to create a SSApp workspace">
        The development of a SSApp needs a special workspace that makes the building and testing flows as efficient as possible.
        An example of such a workspace is the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/PrivateSky/tutorial-workspace.git">tutorial-workspace</a>.
        The tutorial-workspace repo contains the basic files, configurations and dependencies that are needed to help populate
        the entire workspace with the necessary sub projects and code, plus a few useful use-case examples.
        <psk-img src="/assets/images/faq/ssapp-workspace-structure.png" title="SSApp workspace structure"></psk-img>

        After the local cloning of tutorial-workspace repo, an installation process can be performed by running the <code>npm install</code> command
        in the project’s directory. The installation process is done by the <webc-link tag="octopus">Octopus</webc-link>  task runner which reads
        the <code>octopus.json</code> file and, based on the information found in the file, runs the tasks that need to be completed to obtain a fully working
        workspace project.
        <psk-img src="/assets/images/faq/installation.png" title="SSApp workspace installation"></psk-img>

        Once the installation process finishes, the developer can access all the sub projects that are added in the workspace.
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="How to add new projects to a SSApp workspace">
        To manage the workspace and to reliably replicate the workspace’s structure, new projects should be added with the help of Octopus.
        The command:
            <psk-code language="bash">npm run add projectName http://git_repo_url_of_project</psk-code>
        tells Octopus to clone the project into the current workspace and save all the details in the octopus.json file for later command replay.
        The <code>projectName</code> argument indicates the directory name under which the code found at <code>http://git_repo_url_of_project</code>  needs to be cloned.
        It doesn’t matter what type of project we want to add to the workspace (SSApp source code, wallet type source code or other kind of business logic source code) - the command is the same.
    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="How to install a SSApp">
        <p>For each newly created SSApp prototype we recommend the usage of a separate Git repository in order to keep the code safe and track the SSApp’s history.
        To create a new SSApp prototype and add it to your workspace, follow this
        <webc-link href="https://github.com/PrivateSky/tutorial-workspace#hello-world-ssapp-tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial</webc-link>.
        Also check some examples of SSApps: 
        <webc-link href="https://github.com/PrivateSky/ssapp-template">ssapp-template</webc-link>,
        <webc-link href="https://github.com/PrivateSky/ssapp-minimal-app#readme">ssapp-minimal-app</webc-link>.</p>
        <!--To create a new SSApp prototype project structure please follow the 
        <webc-link href="/how-to/a-ssapp">How to create a SSApp</webc-link> tutorial ,
        which explains the steps that the creation of a <code>SSApp</code> requires. -->
        <p>Once the new SSApp prototype project structure is constructed based on the above mentioned tutorial, developers can write their code.
        The installation process of a SSApp prototype project is performed by the Octopus task runner which follows the steps described in the octopus.json file.
        When the <code>npm install</code> command is executed, Octopus runs the necessary commands that add the Cardinal distribution code and PrivateSky distribution bundles
        to the SSApp source code. The image below shows the folder structure of a SSApp prototype.</p>
        <psk-img src="/assets/images/faq/ssapp-prototype-structure.png" title="SSApp prototype structure"></psk-img>

        The main directories in which the code should be placed are <code>/domain</code> and <code>/code</code>.
        The purpose of the <code>/domain</code> directory is to store all the code needed to add custom <b>SWARM</b> definitions if the SSApp business logic requires it.
        During the build process of the SSApp prototype, the content of the domain directory is converted into a PrivateSky type bundle.
        The <code>/code</code> directory contains all the HTML, CSS, Javascript code and other assets the SSApp needs.

        The build process of the SSApp prototype is carried out with the help of a custom tailored script. The result of the script execution is a file called
        <code>SEED</code> which contains the Seed of the DSU created for the SSApp prototype.
        To start the build process run the following command:
        <psk-code language="bash">npm run build</psk-code>

    <psk-chapter title="How to build a new wallet-type">
        <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="issue">deprecated</psk-highlight>
        When building a new type of wallet, a short sequence of commands needs to be run.
        
            <psk-card title="Create a wallet type name and install the loader for it">
                <psk-code language="bash">
                    npm run add web-server/{name_of_wallet_type}/loader http://github.com/privatesky/web-dossier-loader.git
                </psk-code>

                <b>Note:</b> Choose and replace <code>name_of_wallet_type</code> with the name of the new wallet type.
            </psk-card>

            <psk-card title="Setup the Wallet Type Prototype that will be used as base for the wallet">
                <psk-code language="bash">
                    npm run bind-wallet {name_of_wallet_type} wallet_prototype
                </psk-code>
                <b>Note:</b> <code>wallet_prototype</code> can be one from the list: menu-wallet-prototype, dossier-explorer-wallet-type or custom others.
            </psk-card>

            <psk-card title="Install SSApps from workspace in the wallet">
                <psk-code language="bash">
                    npm run bind-app {name_of_wallet_type} name_of_ssapp_prototype
                </psk-code>
                <b>Note:</b> Run the <code>bind-app</code> command for each SSApp prototype that we need in our new wallet type.
            </psk-card>
        

        To test the result open a browser and go to <code>http://localhost:8080/{name_of_wallet_type}/loader/</code>.

    <psk-chapter title="How to customize a wallet">
        A wallet can be customized by adding new SSApps into his configuration or by modifying the menu’s structure, pages’ content or custom business logic.
        Most of the time we don’t need to write code for a new wallet prototype as we can reuse  existing code and just customize the configuration or make
        code updates to meet our business logic’s requirements.
        <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="example">
            Note: In the following chapter we use <code>tutorial-workspace</code> and navigate to the <code>web-wallet</code> directory. The <code>Web-Wallet</code> from
            <code>tutorial-workspace/web-server/web-wallet</code> represents a general purpose web type wallet. Web-wallet allows us to navigate inside a DSU and display
            its contents. It is customizable through SSApp installations.
            The following image highlights the basic structure of the web-wallet and the data that will be used when the web loader will create new instances of
            wallets.
        </psk-highlight>

        <psk-img src="/assets/images/faq/web-server-structure.png" title="Web server folder structure"></psk-img>

        You can can see that the <code>web-server/web-wallet</code> directory has three main sub folders:
        <psk-list list-type="unordered">
            <psk-card title="Loader">
              A directory that contains the source code found at <a href="http://github.com/privatesky/web-dossier-loader.git">http://github.com/privatesky/web-dossier-loader.git</a> and represents the code of a simple
                web app capable of creating new wallet instances based on the information found in the <code>web-server/web-wallet directory</code>.
            </psk-card>
            <psk-card title="Wallet-Template">
                 A directory that contains a seed file with the SEED of the Dossier that stores the code of <code>dossier-explorer-wallet-prototype</code>;
                it can also store files that are loaded at runtime instead of the files stored inside <code>dossier-explorer-wallet-prototype</code>’s Dossier.
            </psk-card>
            <psk-card title="Apps">
             An index directory that stores data about SSApps that can be automatically installed into new wallets.
                The data consists in seed files for each SSApp prototype and customization files like the ones found in the <code>wallet-template</code> directory.
            </psk-card>
        </psk-list>

        <psk-chapter title="Customizing a wallet by adding a new SSApp">
            To add a new SSApp into a wallet run the following command:
            <psk-code>
                npm run bind-app web-wallet ssapp_prototype_name
            </psk-code>
            The <code>bind-app</code> command ensures that the <code>ssapp_prototype</code> is built by running <code><b>npm run build</b></code> command in
            the <code>ssapp_prototype</code> source code directory and copies the seed file into the <code>web-wallet/apps/ssapp_name</code> directory.
        </psk-chapter>

        <psk-chapter title="Customizing a wallet by changing the menu structure">
            Our web-wallet solution uses the <code>dossier-explorer-wallet-prototype</code> as a wallet base and if we need to change the menu structure of the
            <code>web-wallet</code> we have to create a file called <code><b>menu.json</b></code> in <code>/web-server/wallet-template</code> directory.
            At this moment we can make changes in our new <code>menu.json</code> file as we wish. Example of menu.json content:
            <psk-code language="json">
                {
                  "defaultMenuConfig": {
                    "icon": "fa-bars",
                    "type": "route",
                    "component": "psk-page-loader",
                    "exact": false,
                    "indexed": true,
                    "historyType": "browser"
                  },
                  "pages": [
                    {
                      "name": "Home",
                      "path": "/home",
                      "pageSrc": "view-profile.html"
                    },
                    {
                      "name": "Edit",
                      "path": "/edit",
                      "pageSrc": "edit-profile.html"
                    },
                    {
                      "name": "Share",
                      "path": "/share",
                      "pageSrc": "share.html"
                    }
                  ]
                }

            </psk-code>
            Our new <code>menu.json</code> file will be loaded instead of the <code>menu.json</code>
            file stored inside <code>dossier-explorer-wallet-prototype</code> that is bound to our web-wallet.

    <psk-chapter title="What is the Loader's purpose?">
        The Loader is a simple web application capable of instantiating a new wallet or recovering one based on the user’s option.
        The Loader doesn’t have any external dependencies except for the PrivateSky bundles that facilitate the interaction with <webc-link href="/api/edfs/overview">EDFS</webc-link>.
        To build a wallet on the user’s request, the Loader communicates with the web server to retrieve the necessary details like wallet type seed,
        wallet customization content and ssapps prototypes’ seeds. After the information is accessible, the Loader passes through the phases illustrated
        in the workflow below:
        <psk-img src="/assets/images/faq/build-workflow.png" title="Build workflow"></psk-img>
        Basically, the Loader creates a Dossier instance and then mounts at specific paths the Wallet type prototype code, and newly created SSApp instances
        using the seeds of the SSApp prototypes.
        The instantiation process of new SSApp, presented in the following diagram, is executed for each SSApp found in the folder <code>/web-server/web-wallet/apps</code>.
