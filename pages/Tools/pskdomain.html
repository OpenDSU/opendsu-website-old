            <p>
            Creates a privatesky domain as a new CSB that contains the constitution at <code>constitutionPath</code>. This
            command generates a CSB whose SEED is associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <code>alias</code>
            argument. A prompt that requires the insertion of a PIN will appear. The provided PIN will be required for
            all subsequent commands.

            Creates a BAR that stores the files at <code>localPath</code>. The command generates a BAR whose SEED is
            associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <code>alias</code> argument.

            Adds the files at <code>localPath</code> to the BAR whose SEED is associated locally with the <code>barAlias</code>
            argument. The files are added in BAR at bar <code>barPath</code>.

        <psk-chapter title="update constitution">
            <p class="subtitle"><i>domainAlias constitutionPath</i></p>
            <p>
            Replaces the constitution in the domain whose SEED is associated with <code>domainAlias</code> with the
            constitution at <code>constitutionPath</code>.

        <psk-chapter title="add agent">

            <p>
            Adds agent <code>agentAlias</code> to the domain whose SEED is associated with <code>domainAlias</code>. A prompt for
            PIN introduction will appear.

        <psk-chapter title="set pin">
            <p>
            Allows the change of PIN. Firstly, a prompt that requires the current PIN will appear. After the PIN is
            validated another prompt will appear for the introduction of the new PIN.

        <psk-chapter title="anchor">
            <p class="subtitle"><i>anchoreeAlias anchoratorAlias</i></p>
            <p>
            Allows the anchoring of the domain whose SEED is associated locally with the <code>anchoreeAlias</code> argument
            inside the domain whose SEED is associated with the <code>anchoratorAlias</code>. By anchoring it is meant that
            “anchorator” domain contains the hash of the anchorated domain, thus reflecting each change of the latter in
            the former.

            Concept| Description
            BAR | An archive that stores files that were previously divided into blocks called bricks. A BAR is referenced by its SEED. The SEED could be also used to encrypt the archive.

            CSB | An encrypted BAR that contains a blockchain.

            SEED | A string used to derive the encryption keys for  BARs. It is also used for referencing BARs.

            SEED Cage | A dictionary that stores domainAliases and SEEDs.

            PIN | A string used to derive the key used for the SEED Cage encryption.

            Domain | A domain is a CSB that stores domain constitutions.

            Domain Constitution | A list of files that contain assets and transactions used for the manipulation of a domain’s blockchain.
