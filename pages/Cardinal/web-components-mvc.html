<psk-description>CardinalIJS (or sometimes simply Cardinal) is introducing a programming mode (it is a micro framework) oriented to enable the rapid development of WEB applications (RAD - Rapid Application Development or low code development). Cardinal appeared because of the frustration experienced with other frameworks and it aims at providing a guide  for fast and safe programming of SSApp graphic interface.</psk-description>

<psk-chapter title="We bet on Web Components">
<p align="justify">For security reasons (minimizing the SSApp code), as well as to accelerate development, we chose to build Cardinal on the Web Component standard.</p>
<p align="justify">The HTML programming model provided by the web-components technology enables the possibility to create your own tags as reusable components. The first obvious application of web-components in the PrivateSky ecosystem is the very page you are looking at (privatesky.xyz) because the entire site runs on CardinalIJS and the components it provides. In order to easily describe and publish this paper we opted to employ our own proprietary technology.</p>
</psk-chapter>

<psk-chapter title="Between MVC and MVVM">
<p align="justify">Cardinal provides a mature and robust programming framework based on MVC and MVVM.</p>

<p align="justify">In Cardinal “the models" are loaded and set up by “controllers". If required, the Controller is setting up a View Model (an adapted model easier to connect to the VIew). The View part in Cardinal is accomplished by describing “pages" using the tag <i>psk-page</i> and by writing HTML tags that are loading the web components provided by Cardinal and described in the PSK Wiki and Web Components sections of this site.</p>

<p align="justify">The controllers may only be attached  to certain components: psk-page, psk-container, etc.</p> 

<p align="justify">The components in view may communicate between them and to the controller using DOM transmitted messages.
We encourage you to read the pages below in order to comprehend other specificities related to model use, views, controllers and events in Cardinal. </p>
